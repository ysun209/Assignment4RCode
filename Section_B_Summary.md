# Section B - Summary of Results

## Overview
This document summarizes the results from Section B of Assignment 4, which analyzes the Child Health and Development Studies dataset (1961-1962) examining the relationship between maternal characteristics and baby health.

**Dataset:** Section B Dataset - Gestation_final.csv  
**Total Observations:** 1,236 children  
**Script:** Section_B.R

## Task 17: Scatter Plot of Baby's Birth Weight vs Mother's Pre-pregnancy Weight
**Output:** `task17_birthweight_vs_mother_weight.png`

A scatter plot showing the relationship between:
- X-axis: Mother's pre-pregnancy weight (pounds)
- Y-axis: Baby's birth weight (ounces)

The plot uses blue circles and is properly labeled with title and axis labels.

## Task 18: Modified Scatter Plot with Trend Line
**Output:** `task18_birthweight_vs_mother_weight_with_trendline.png`

Same relationship as Task 17, but with:
- Triangle symbols (instead of circles)
- Red linear trend line added to show the direction of association

## Task 19: Strength of Association
**Test Used:** Pearson Correlation Test

### Results:
- **Correlation coefficient (r):** 0.1540
- **t-statistic:** 5.3960
- **Degrees of freedom:** 1,198
- **p-value:** < 0.001 (highly significant)
- **95% CI:** [0.0983, 0.2088]

### Interpretation:
The Pearson correlation test shows a **weak positive association** (r = 0.1540, p < 0.001) between baby's birth weight and mother's pre-pregnancy weight. While statistically significant, the correlation is weak, meaning that mother's pre-pregnancy weight explains only a small portion of the variation in baby's birth weight.

## Task 20: Missing Data Analysis

### Key Findings:
- **Total babies in dataset:** 1,236
- **Babies included in correlation analysis:** 1,200
- **Babies excluded:** 36 (2.9%)

### Reason for Exclusion:
36 babies weren't included in the correlation analysis because they had missing data for mother's pre-pregnancy weight (wt.1). Correlation analysis requires complete data for both variables to calculate the association between them.

**Breakdown:**
- Missing baby's birth weight: 0
- Missing mother's pre-pregnancy weight: 36
- Missing both values: 0

## Task 21: Analysis of Babies with Gestation < 270 Days

**Filtered Dataset:** `task21_gestation_filtered_under270.csv`

### A. Percentage of Cohort Remaining
**Answer:** 18.4% (228 out of 1,236 babies)

### B. Median and Interquartile Range of Gestation
- **Median gestation:** 261.0 days
- **Interquartile range (IQR):** 16.0 days

### C. Mother's Age Statistics
- **Mean:** 28.0 years
- **Standard Deviation:** 6.0 years

### Additional Context:
In this subset of premature births (gestation < 270 days):
- Gestation range: 148.0 to 269.0 days
- Mean gestation: 256.6 days (SD = 14.6)
- Mean birth weight: 106.0 oz

## Files Generated

1. **task17_birthweight_vs_mother_weight.png** - Basic scatter plot
2. **task18_birthweight_vs_mother_weight_with_trendline.png** - Scatter plot with trend line
3. **task21_gestation_filtered_under270.csv** - Filtered dataset for further analysis

## Key Takeaways

1. There is a statistically significant but weak positive relationship between mother's pre-pregnancy weight and baby's birth weight.

2. The dataset is relatively complete, with only 2.9% of cases excluded from the correlation analysis due to missing data.

3. About 18% of babies in the cohort had gestation periods under 270 days (premature births), with a typical gestation of 261 days in this subgroup.

4. The mean maternal age for mothers of premature babies (< 270 days gestation) was 28.0 years.
