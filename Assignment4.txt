## Assignment overview

In this assignment, you will provide a record of practical work done with analysis software. There are three sections, each with their own individual tasks. Ensure you work through all sections. 

This assignment supports [course learning outcomes 1, 2, 3 and 4](# "course learning outcomes 1, 2, 3 and 4"). 

## Assignment details

Load iNZight Lite and if required, refer to information about the software at [iNZight Lite](http://lite.docker.stat.auckland.ac.nz/) (iNZight, 2023). You may use R, SAS, Stata or Python for this assignment if you prefer. Please write which software you are using at the start of the assignment. 

You must complete all three sections and **submit one PDF** containing your answers, calculations, tables and plots separated for each section (Sections A, B and C).

**Select** the three headings to explore each section.

### Section A

In 2024, a group of endocrinologists thought more people in their clinics were developing anaemia than they were used to seeing. They were suspicious that it could be related to a medication that many of their patients were taking. They recruited 882 adults (aged 18 and older) who were taking that medication, assessed their heart rate, blood pressure and haemoglobin at baseline and again 6 months later.  You have been provided with an extract of the data they collected.

For women, anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin < 115 g/L; for men, it is defined as a haemoglobin < 130 g/L.

#### Tasks

Load the dataset Anaemia. The variables in the dataset are:

-   pt\_id: patient ID
-   age: age in years
-   gender: M = Male, F = Female
-   ethnic\_gp: 1 = European, 2 = Pacific Peoples, 3 = Māori, 4 = Chinese
-   heart\_rate: at baseline, in beats per minute (bpm)
-   sbp: systolic blood pressure at baseline, in mmHg
-   dbp: diastolic blood pressure at baseline, in mmHg
-   haemoglobin: haemoglobin at baseline, in g/L
-   heart\_rate\_6m: at 6 months, in beats per minute (bpm)sbp: systolic blood pressure at baseline, in mmHg
-   sbp\_6m: systolic blood pressure at 6 months, in mmHg
-   dbp\_6m: diastolic blood pressure at 6 months, in mmHg
-   haemoglobin\_6m: haemoglobin at 6 months, in g/L

**Task 1 (7 marks):** Complete the following table to summarise the key characteristics of the cohort.  Add any extra rows needed to complete the information for the listed variables. Values should be mean (SD) **or** median (IQR) **or** n(%) as appropriate to describe the distribution or prevalence of characteristics in the total cohort and stratified by sex

**Task 2 (1 mark):** What percentage of the cohort are Māori? 

**Task 3 (1 mark):** What percentage of Māori are women? 

**Task 4 (2 marks):** Using a boxplot, show the distributions of age stratified by ethnic group, ie. show the distribution of age for each ethnic group. 

**Task 5 (2 marks)**: Using histograms, plot the distribution of age stratified by gender.

**Task 6 (1 mark)**: Is the distribution of age for men skewed to the right or skewed to the left? 

**Task 7 (2 marks)**: IIs the difference in mean haemoglobin at baseline between European and Chinese people statistically significant? Explain your answer in one sentence. 

**Task 8 (1 mark)**: Calculate the change in Hb from baseline to 6 months as the value at baseline minus the value at 6 months.  What is the mean (SD) of the change in Hb? 

**Task 9 (1 mark)**: Was the mean change in Hb higher for women or for men?  You do not need to assess if it is statistically significant.

**Task 10 (3 marks)**: What percentage of women who started the study were shown to have a decrease in Hb over that time of  > 15 g/L ? 

**Task 11 (4 marks)**:  Create 2 variables representing anaemia at baseline and at 6 months, with values of Yes, No or Missing.  Tabulate gender against anaemia and paste the table your software creates into the assignment. 

**Task 12 (1 mark)**: What is the median and interquartile interval of age at baseline for people with anaemia? 

**Task 13 (1 mark)**: Among the people with anaemia, is the median age higher for women or men? 

**Task 14 (1 mark)**: What percentage of people who had anaemia at baseline did not still have anaemia at 6 months? 

**Task 15 (1 mark)**: What percentage of people who did not have anaemia at baseline had developed anaemia 6 months later? 

**Task 16 (1 mark)**: Without doing further statistical tests, write one sentence to say whether you think there has been an increase in anaemia in this group of patients. 







### Section B

Child Health and Development Studies done in 1961 and 1962 were the basis of research presented by Nolan and Speed to address the question of whether there is a link between maternal smoking and their baby’s health.

The following variables have been retained from this publicly available dataset. It has data on 1236 children.

-   id: identification number

-   sex:  infant's sex, where 1=male, 2=female
-   wt: baby’s birth weight, in ounces (oz)
-   race:  mother's race, where 0-5=white, 6=mexican,7=black, 8=Asian, 9=mixed
-   age:  mother's age, in years
-   ht: mother's height, in inches
-   wt.1: mother's pre-pregnancy weight, in pounds (lbs)
-   drace: father's race (a factor with levels equivalent to mother's race)
-   dage: father's age, in years
-   dht: father's height, in inches
-   dwt: father's weight, in pounds (lbs)
-   smoke: does the mother smoke cigarettes? 0=never, 1=smokes now, 2=until current pregnancy, 3=once did, not now
-   time:  time since quitting smoking: 0=never smoked, 1=still smokes, 2=during current preg, 3=within 1 yr, 4=1 to 2 years ago, 5= 2 to 3 yr ago, 6= 3 to 4 yrs ago, 7=5 to 9yrs ago, 8=10+yrs ago, 9=quit or don't know
-   number: number of cigs smoked per day for past and current smokers 0=never, 1=1-4, 2=5-9, 3=10-14, 4=15-19, 5=20-29, 6=30-39, 7=40-60, 8=60+, 9=smoke but don't know

#### Tasks

Load the dataset Gestation. 

**Task 17 (2 marks):** Plot baby’s birth weight against mother’s pre-pregnancy weight, ensuring the graph is labelled correctly. Paste this plot into your assignment.

**Task 18 (1 mark):** Paste another version of this plot after changing the symbol being plotted (to a symbol of your choosing) and adding a red linear trend line. 

**Task 19 (2 marks)**: Describe the strength of association between baby’s birth weight against mother’s pre-pregnancy weight. Include the name of the test used to obtain this. 

**Task 20 (2 marks)**: Some babies weren’t included in the analysis of the strength of association.  How many weren’t included and why were they not in it?  

**Task 21 (3 marks)**: Filter the data to only include people with gestation < 270 days.

  A. What percentage of the cohort are left in the data? 

  B. What is the median and interquartile range of the gestation in this subset of people? 

  C. Report to 1 decimal place the mean and standard deviation of mother’s age in this subset of people.









### Section C

This section is based on modified data from a randomised controlled trial about primary biliary cirrhosis of the liver conducted by the Mayo Clinic between 1974 and 1984. The trial randomised people with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) to receive either a drug (D-penicillamine) or a placebo.  In addition, the cohort includes 97 people who were not randomised but had measurements at baseline and were followed for the endpoint. The status of everyone in the cohort at the end of follow-up was therefore recorded as either transplant, dead, or censored.

Variables in the dataset are as follows:

-   age: In years
-   albumin: Serum albumin (g/dl)
-   alk.phos: Alkaline phosphatase (U/liter)
-   ascites: Presence of ascites
-   ast: Aspartate aminotransferase, once called SGOT (U/ml)
-   bili: Serum bilirubin (mg/dl)
-   chol: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
-   copper: Urine copper (ug/day)
-   edema: 0 no edema, 0.5 untreated or successfully treated 1 edema despite diuretic therapy
-   hepato: Presence of hepatomegaly or enlarged liver
-   id: Case number
-   platelet: Platelet count
-   protime: Standardised blood clotting time
-   sex: M/f
-   spiders: Blood vessel malformations in the skin
-   stage: Histologic stage of disease (needs biopsy)
-   status: Status at endpoint, 0/1/2 for censored, transplant, dead
-   time: Number of days between registration and the earlier of death, transplantation, or study analysis in July, 1986
-   trt: Treatment group, 1/2/NA for D-penicillmine, placebo, not randomised
-   trig: Triglycerides (mg/dl).

#### Tasks

Load the dataset called pbc.csv (CSV 31 KB). 

**Task 22 (3 marks)**: Convert albumin to a categorical variable of two groups: Group A = up to and including the median, Group B = above the median. What is the median albumin for each of the two groups, to 2 decimal places?

**Task 23 (6 marks):** Convert treatment group and endpoint status to categorical variables and compare in a table.  Transfer the output of the software into a table that could be included in a report or manuscript that will be submitted to a journal for publication and paste this in your assignment. Now answer the following questions:

1.  How many people in the cohort had a transplant?
2.  What percentage of those who had a transplant were in the placebo group?
3.  What percentage of the D-pencillamine group died?

**Task 24 (5 marks):** Merge the endpoint status of transplantation and died into one group, creating a new variable called 'outcome.binary', where 0 = censored and 1 = transplant or died. Calculate and briefly discuss the risk of having a transplant or dying in the D-pencillamine group compared to the placebo group.

**Task 25 (6 marks):** Convert ‘stage’ to a categorical variable. Now answer the following questions:

1.  Which stage has the most people in it?
2.  What is the mean (SD) of bilirubin in each of the 4 stages?
3.  To assess mean age of people in each stage, select Inference and Hypothesis testing using ANOVA.  The output includes an F-test and corresponding p-value. Interpret the p-value.
4.  One of the results in the output in iNZight shows the difference in mean age of people in stage 3 with those in stage 4. Interpret the findings of that analysis.  
    If you are not using iNZight software, assess the paired differences in means, paste the output you get, and report the findings of the difference in mean age of people in stage 3 with those in stage 4.
